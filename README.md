# CapitalCord 
This simple plugins allows for free speach within the powerCord server.

# How does it work?
CapitalCord is a PowerCord only plugin, it simply liberates your rights in so many ways! 
When the word "powercord" is said in chat with a lowercase "c", it will automatically be changed client side to show with an uppercase "C" instead.
